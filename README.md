# Algorithm: Validating Brackets in a String

## Approach

Here is the step-by-step approach of the algorithm:

1. **Initialize an empty stack**: 
   Begin by creating an empty stack to help keep track of opening brackets.

2. **Traverse the input string character by character**: 
   Process each character in the input string one at a time.

3. **Handle opening brackets**:
   - If the current character is an opening bracket (i.e., `'('`, `'{'`, `'['`), push it onto the stack.

4. **Handle closing brackets**:
   - If the current character is a closing bracket (i.e., `')'`, `'}'`, `']'`), check the stack:
     - If the stack is empty, return `false`, as the closing bracket does not have a corresponding opening bracket.
     - Otherwise, pop the top element from the stack and check if it matches the current closing bracket. 
       - If it does not match, return `false`, as the brackets are not valid.

5. **Final check**:
   - After traversing the entire string, check if the stack is empty:
     - If the stack is empty, return `true`, indicating all opening brackets have been matched with corresponding closing brackets.
     - If the stack is not empty, return `false`, as some opening brackets have not been matched.

## Complexity

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n)**: The algorithm traverses the string once and performs constant-time operations for each character.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(n)**: In the worst case, all opening brackets are present in the string, and the stack needs to store all of them.

**Example**: Input string: `"({[]})"`

1. Push `'('` onto the stack.
2. Push `'{'` onto the stack.
3. Push `'['` onto the stack.
4. Match `']'` with `'['` (pop stack).
5. Match `'}'` with `'{'` (pop stack).
6. Match `')'` with `'('` (pop stack).

Stack is empty; hence, the output is `true`.
